III.  Introduction


BonnMotion  is  a  Java  software  which  creates  and analyses mobility
scenarios. It is developed within the Communication Systems group at the
Institute  of  Computer  Science  IV of the University of Bonn, Germany,
where it serves as a tool for the investigation of mobile ad hoc network
characteristics.  The  scenarios  can  also  be exported for the network
simulator ns-2 and GlomoSim/QualNet.


IV.   Installation


To use this software, you need to have a JDK or JRE  installed.  It  has
been compiled and tested with Java v1.5.0_04.

During  the  installation,  a  few other shell scripts / batch files are
created in the "bin" folder, which you can move and rename as you like:

o  "bm" is a wrapper that starts the BonnMotion application. Starting it
   without command line parameters prints a detailed help message.

o  "compile"  re-compiles the sources. By default, only applies to files
   that were changed after  the  last  compilation.  To  re-compile  all
   sources, use "compile all".

o  "makedoc" uses javadoc to create a source code documentation.

This  distribution  includes  the  compiled class files so if you do not
want to modify the code, there is no need for you to run the compile  or

makedoc scripts.


1. Installation on UNIX operating systems

If  you are using a UNIX platform, simply unpack the archive and run the
"install" script. You will then be asked for the location of  your  Java
binary  path,  i.e.  the  directory  containing the Java interpreter and
possibly the Java compiler and the javadoc utility.

NOTE: We have not yet run our shell  scripts  on  other  platforms  than
Linux  ot  Cygwin.  We  would  be happy if you informed us about changes
necessary  to  run  them  under  other  operating  systems  so  we   can
incorporate them into our distribution.


2. Installation on Microsoft Windows operating systems

NOTE:  The  batch  files  for  MS  Windows  have not yet been thoroughly
tested.

If you are using  Microsoft  Windows,  please  edit  the  two  variables
JAVAPATH and BONNMOTION in the "install.bat" and then execute it.


V.    Running


All  applications  described  below  are  started  via  the "bm" wrapper
script. The syntax is as follows:

   bm <parameters> <application> <application parameters>

The  application  can  be  a  mobility  model  or  e.g.  the  Statistics
application used to analyse scenario characteristics.

Starting the script without command line parameters prints further help.
Usage examples are given in the sections below.


VI.   Scenario generation


Currently,  there  are  five  mobility  models  available,   which   are
introduced  later  on  with some comments on implementation details. For
further  details  on  the  models  themselves,  please  refer   to   the
literature. An overview over several models is given in:

BonnMotion                         -4-                     Documentation


   T. Camp, J. Boleng, and V. Davies, A Survey of Mobility Models for Ad
   Hoc Network  Research,  Wireless  Communication  &  Mobile  Computing
   (WCMC):  Special  issue on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking: Research, Trends
   and Applications, vol. 2, no. 5, pp. 483-502, 2002

The Manhattan Grid model is introduced in:

   Selection  Procedures  for   the   Choice   of   Radio   Transmission
   Technologies of the UMTS (TS30.03 v3.2.0). TS 30.03 3GPP, April 1998.

There are two possibilities to feed input parameters into  the  scenario
generation:  The  first  is to enter the parameters on the command line,
and the second is to have a file containing the  parameters.  These  two
methods  can also be combined; in this case, the command line parameters
override those given in the input file.

The scenario generator writes all parameters used to  create  a  certain
scenario  to  a  file.  In  this  way, settings are saved and particular
scenario parameters can be varied without the need to re-enter all other
parameters.

Important  parameters  used  with all models are the following: The node
number is set with -n, the scenario duration (in seconds)  with  -d  and
the -i parameter specifies, how many additional seconds at the beginning
of the scenario should be skipped. With -x and -y, the width and  height
(in metres) of the simulation area are set. With -R, the random seed can
be set manually.

Cutting off the initial phase is an important feature and therefore,  -i
has  a  high  default  value:  It has been observed that with the Random
Waypoint model, nodes have a higher probability of being near the center
of  the  simulation area, while they are initially uniformly distributed
over the simulation area. In our implementation of  the  Manhattan  Grid
model, all nodes start at (0,0) for simplicity.

Usage examples:

   bm -f scenario1 RandomWaypoint -n 100 -d 900 -i 3600

This creates a Random Waypoint scenario with 100 nodes and a duration of
900 seconds. An initial phase of 3600 seconds is cut off.

A scenario is saved in two files: The first, with the suffix  ".params",
contains  the  complete  set  of parameters used for the simulation. The
second, with the suffix ".movements.gz" contains the (gzipped)  movement
data.

Now,  you  can  take  a  look  at the "scenario1.params" file to see all



Institute of Computer Science IV, University of Bonn            [Page 4]

BonnMotion                         -5-                     Documentation


parameters used for the simulation,  and  if  you  wanted  to  create  a
similar scenario, only with a higher mobility, you can do this with

   bm -f scenario2 -I scenario1.params RandomWaypoint -h 5.0

which  takes the whole parameter set from scenario1.params and overrides
the maximum speed with 5 m/s.


1. The Random Waypoint model ("RandomWaypoint")


Our  implementation  includes  a  feature  to  restrict   the   mobiles'
movements:  With  "-d 1", nodes move only along the x-axis, with "-d 2",
nodes move either along the x- or along the y-axis (with  a  probability
of  0.5  each)  and  with the default "-d 3", it is the classical Random
Waypoint model as you know it.

Another feature is the "-c" switch that causes positions  to  be  chosen
from  a  circle  that fits into the simulation area rather than from the
simulation area itself.

Instead of choosing new  destinations  uniformly  distributed  from  the
simulation  area,  "attraction  points"  can  be  defined  with the "-a"
parameter, followed by the data characterising  the  attraction  points.
Each attraction point is defined by four floating point numbers, in this
order:  <x-coordinate>,  <y-coordinate>,  <intensity>,   and   <standard
deviation>.

o  The coordinates give the attraction point's position.

o  The  intensity  levels  weight the attraction points: A point with an
   intensity x times as high as another point's will also attract a node
   with a probability which is x times as high.

o  The  last  parameter  is  the  standard  deviation  of  the  Gaussian
   distribution with mean  0  that  is  used  to  determine  the  nodes'
   distances  to  the  attraction  point  on  each of the two dimensions
   (i.e., the distance  to  the  attraction  point  does  not  follow  a
   Gaussian distribution, but a Rayleigh distribution).

The  parameters  for  several attraction points are simply concatenated,
seperated by commas. For example, to place two attraction points on  the
simulation  area,  the  first at (100,100) with intensity 1 and standard
deviation 20, the second at (350,200) with intensity  1.5  and  standard
deviation 31, use "-a 100,100,1,20,350,200,1.5,31".

2. The Manhattan Grid model ("ManhattanGrid")


In this model, nodes move only on predefined paths. The arguments -u and
-v set the number of blocks between the paths. As an example, "-u  3  -v
2" places the following paths on the simulation area:

   +-+-+-+
   | | | |
   +-+-+-+
   | | | |
   +-+-+-+

Our  implementation  contains  some  (reasonable)  modifications  of the
Manhattan Grid model:

1) An additional parameter we introduce is the minimum speed of a mobile
node.  This  is helpful because the speed of a mobile can be arbitrarily
close to 0 and since the model defines that the speed is to  be  updated
in  _distance_  intervals,  there  can be very long periods of very slow
node movement without this parameter.

2) The possibility to have nodes  pause  was  added  with  help  of  two
additional  parameters: The pause probability (if a node does not change
its speed, it will pause with that probability) and  the  maximum  pause
time.

Note  that  it  is especially important to cut off an initial phase with
this model, because in our implementation, all nodes start at  the  same
position (0,0).


3a. The original Gauss-Markov model ("OriginalGaussMarkov")


This implementation of the Gauss-Markov model follows the publication

   B.  Liang  and Z. Haas, Predictive distance-based mobility management
   for  PCS  networks,  Proceedings  of  the  IEEE  INFOCOM  1999,   pp.
   1377-1384.

In  this  implementation,  the  mean velocity vector mu is not specified
directly; instead, the norm is specified using "-a" and a random  vector
with  this  norm  is  assigned  to  each station. Of course, a norm of 0
yields only the vector (0,0). The implementation also allows the user to
specify  a  maximum speed. A velocity vectors with a larger norm will be
multiplied with an appropriate scalar to reduce the speed to the maximum
speed.



Institute of Computer Science IV, University of Bonn            [Page 6]

BonnMotion                         -7-                     Documentation


The  model  has  been  adapted  to  deal  with  scenario  borders in the
following way: If a station moves onto the border, its  velocity  vector
as well as its expected velocity vector are "mirrored".


3b. The Gauss-Markov model ("GaussMarkov")


This  is  the  implementation  of  the  Gauss-Markov model, which rather
follows the description of  the  Camp/Boleng  publication  cited  above,
though  it  is  not  the  same.  The main commonalites are that for each
mobile node, two seperate values are maintained  instead  of  one  speed
vector:  The  mobile's  speed  and  its  direction of movement. Also the
default method of handling mobile nodes that move out of the  simulation
area  is  closely  related  to  the  Camp/Boleng  publication: Nodes may
continue to walk  beyond  the  area  boundary,  which  causes  the  next
movement  vector  update  not  to be based on the prior angle, but on an
angle that brings the nodes back onto the field.  Therefore,  the  field
size  is  automatically  adapted  to  the  node movements after scenario
generation.

The main difference to the Camp/Boleng publication is that new speed and
direction  of movement are simply chosen from a normal distribution with
a mean of the respective old value (the standard deviation is  specified
on  the command line using -a and -s). Speed values are constrained to a
certain interval that can be specified on the command line using -m  and
-h:  If  a  newly  chosen speed value is outside of this interval, it is
changed to the closest value inside of the interval (which is either the
minimum or the maximum value).

The  behaviour described above can be modified with several command line
switches: Using -b, the size of the simulation area is fixed  and  nodes
simply  "bounce"  at  the  area  boundaries.  Using -u, the speed values
outside of the valid speed interval are adapted in a way that leads to a
uniform  distribution  of  node  speeds  (instead  of  peaks  around the
interval boundaries).


4. The Reference Point Group Mobility model ("RPGM")


The implementation of  this  model  includes  the  possibility  to  have
"dynamic"  groups:  When a node comes into the area of another group, it
changes to this new group with a probability that can be  set  with  "-c
<probability>". Deactivate this feature with "-c 0". Note that when this
feature is activated, "empty" groups may be moving along the  simulation
area  and  nodes coming into their areas may change their memberships to
these.

BonnMotion                         -8-                     Documentation


5. Static scenarios ("Static")


By default, nodes in static scenarios are homogeneously distributed over
the  simulation  area.  There  are two possibilities for non-homogeneous
node distributions:

o  Attraction points can be defined with the "-a" parameter; a  detailed
   explanation  of  this  feature  is  given  in  the  "Random Waypoint"
   section.

o  With the "-l" parameter, the simulation  area  can  be  divided  into
   several  areas  with different node densities along its x-axis. Given
   the number n of density leves, each of the n  areas  will  contain  a
   fraction of approximately
      2 * k / (n * (n + 1)), 1 <= k <= n,
   of the nodes. (The density decreases from left to right.)

   The  following  example shall illustrate this: Distributing 150 nodes
   on a 300m x 300m field with 3 density levels, approx. 75  nodes  will
   lie  within  the rectangle area with the corners (0,0) and (100,300),
   approx. 50 nodes will lie within (100,0) and (200,300) and approx. 25
   nodes will lie within (200,0) and (300,300).



VII.  Converting scenarios to other formats


1. ns-2


The  "NSFile"  application  is  used  to  generate two files that can be
integrated into a TCL  script  to  start  an  ns-2  simulation  via  the
"source" command.

The  file with the suffix ".ns_params" sets some variables needed to set
up the simulation in an array named "val": the keys "x" and "y" refer to
width  and  height  of the simulation area, "nn" refers to the number of
nodes and "duration" to the duration of the simulation.

The file with the suffix ".ns_movements" schedules the movements of  the
node objects that are expected to be in an array named "node_", numbered
starting at 0. The simulator object is expected to be  in  the  variable
"ns_".

As  a  side  note,  the "NSFile" application places an additional margin
around the simulation area, because ns-2 versions up to 2.1b9a regularly



Institute of Computer Science IV, University of Bonn            [Page 8]

BonnMotion                         -9-                     Documentation


crash  when  nodes move at the border of the simulation area. (Actually,
this has only been observed with the Manhattan Grid model up to now, but
this procedure is generally carried out just to play it safe.)

Usage example:

   bm NSFile -f scenario1

creates      the      two      files      "scenario1.ns_params"      and
"scenario1.ns_movements".


2. Glomosim / Qualnet


The  "GlomoFile"   application   creates   files   with   the   suffixes
".glomo_nodes"  and  ".glomo_mobility",  which can be used with Glomosim
(2.0.3) and Qualnet (3.5.1). Use  the  "-q"  switch  for  Qualnet:  This
causes nodes to be numbered starting at 1, not at 0.


3. XML


The  "SPPXml"  application  is  used  to  generate mobility files in XML
format  according  to  the  XML  schema  proposed  by  Horst   Hellbrück
<horst.hellbrueck@i-u.de> as a standardised mobility file format for the
research          program           "Schwerpunktprogramm           1140"
(http://www.tm.uka.de/forschung/SPP1140/)    of    the   DFG   (Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft).

SPPXml has an additional parameter "-r" that allows to specify a uniform
radio  range  for all nodes. If this parameter is omitted, a radio range
of 250m is used. BonnMotion does not use this radio range in any way. It
is however required by the XML schema.

The  XML  schema corresponding to the XML files generated by "SPPXml" is
defined in:

http://www.i-u.de/schools/hellbrueck/ansim/xml/sppmobtrace.xsd

The  contrib   directory   furthermore   includes   a   python   program
"sppmob2bonnmotion.py"   that   convertw  XML  mobility  traces  to  the
BonnMotion format. It has been tested with Python 2.3.


VIII.   Scenario analysis

BonnMotion                        -10-                     Documentation


1. The Statistics application


The "Statistics" application is used to analyse a given scenario.  There
are  two  modes  of  operation:  The  default  is to calculate "overall"
statistics (averaged over the simulation time) and the other mode is  to
calculate "progressive" statistics (values of metrics for certain points
in time).

In its default mode, the application creates  a  file  with  the  suffix
".stats" containing the following information:


o  The  "relative mobility" is independent of the transmission range and
   is calculated according to

      P. Johansson, T. Larsson, N. Hedman, B. Mielczarek, M.  Degermark,
      Scenario-based  Performance  Analysis  of  Routing  Protocols  for
      Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks, Proceedings of  ACM/IEEE  MOBICOM'99,  pp.
      195-206, Aug. 1999.

o  The  other  figures are dependent on the transmission range, which is
   given in the first column of every line.

o  The second column gives the average node degree: To how many  of  the
   other nodes is one node connected?

o  The  third column gives the average number of partitions: 1 means the
   network is connected at all times, values larger than 1 indicate that
   this is not the case.

o  The  fourth  column  gives the degree of separation: How likely is it
   that two randomly chosen nodes are within a connected component at  a
   randomly chosen point in time?

o  The  fifth column gives the average link duration; only links that go
   up after the simulation start and go down before the  simulation  end
   are taken into account.

o  The  sixth  column  gives  the  standard  deviation  of  the previous
   measure.

o  The seventh column gives  the  number  of  links  considered  in  the
   calculation of the two previous values.

o  The  eighth  column is like the fifth, but this time, _all_ links are
   counted.

BonnMotion                        -11-                     Documentation


o  The ninth column gives the total number of links.

Alternatively to the  statistics  which  are  averaged  over  the  whole
simulation  time,  the  devolution  of  certain  characteristics  can be
calculated. See the command line help and the following examples.

Usage examples:

   bm Statistics -f scenario1 -r 50,75,100

This  writes  the   averaged   statistics   to   "scenario1.stats"   for
transmission ranges of 50, 75, and 100 meters.

   bm Statistics -f scenario1 -r 75 -P

This  creates  a file scenario1.stats_75.part, which gives the number of
partitions each time it changes.

   bm Statistics -f scenario1 -r 50,100 -N -M 10

This    creates    the    files     "scenario1.stats_50.nodedeg"     and
"scenario1.stats_100.nodedeg"  which  show  the  devolution  of the node
degrees.  Furthermore,   the   files   "scenario1.stats_50.mincut"   and
"scenario1.stats_100.mincut"  show the minimal cut of the topology every
10  seconds.  It  is  reasonable  to  specify  such  a  time  span   for
computations that cost much CPU time.


2. The LinkDump application


The  LinkDump  application  prints  information  about every single link
within a certain time span of a scenario. This information can  e.g.  be
used for a simulator that does not directly model mobility at all.

Using  the  -d  switch, only the link durations are printed. This offers
more insight into the distribution of link durations than  the  averaged
value  calculated  by  the  Statistics application. In this case, the -w
switch prevents that wrong durations are printed out due to  links  that
go up before simulation begin or go down after simulation end.


IX.    Scenario visualisation


"Visplot"  is a very simple application that writes those positions to a
file where a mobile changes its speed or direction. This file can simply
be visualised using e.g. gnuplot.
